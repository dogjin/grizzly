        /*! The shape of the attack is determined by the curve factor (clamped to > 0 & < 1).
            A higher value results in a steaper curve and is analogous to the maximum charge of a capacitor.
            By default, the setting is 0.77 and approximates a CEM3310 chip wichh charges to a maximum of 77 percent.
         
            The output (y) of charging is given by: y(n) = 1 - e^(-n/RC), where time constant RC is set to 1 and time n is in samples.
            At n = 1, y = 0.63. We need 5 samples to a full charge of 0.99. In other words, we can go from 0 to 0.99 in one sample (1 - e^((-1 * 5) / 1))
            and use this value to set a maximum charge. In this case 5 is the time constant factor to make this step in one sample.
         
            We can then solve time constant factors for different charges between 0% and 100% with maximum charge = 1 - e^-factor. If we normalise the envelope, the factor determines the shape.
            The envelope is the output of a one-pole filter using a gate signal of 1 or 0 as input. */
